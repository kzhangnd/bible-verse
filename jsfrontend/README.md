## User Interaction 

**Search by Chapter Number:**
    By typing in a chapter number into the first input box, the user can view the content of a particular chapter in the book of Psalms.
    After entering a chapter number, the user can click the "Search" button to view results in the textbox at the bottom of the page.

**Search by Verse Number:**
    By typing in a particular chapter number and verse number into their separate input boxes, the user may view the results of a particular verse   upon clicking the "Search" button.


If the user does not input a chapter number or a verse number and clicks the "Search" button, then the results will be the entire book of Psalm. 
Also, if the user inputs invalid chapter numbers of verse numbers, then they will receive an alert message.


**Search by Keyword:**
    The user can type in a particular keyword and upon clicking the "Search" button, will be able to view all the verses that have that keyword in it. We also have implemented a "fuzzy search" feature. This means that if a user attempts to search for a particular keyword that is not within the book of Psalms, similar results will still pop up.  For example, the word "aladdin" would likely not be in the book of Psalms, but you could search by it and find verses with words that have similar spellings.
